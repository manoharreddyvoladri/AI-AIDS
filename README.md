# AI-AIDS 🔐
AI-Powered Adaptive Intrusion Detection System using ML & RL

## 💡 Overview
A novel project that detects, explains, and automatically responds to cyber threats using Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning. Designed for real-time security, inspired by Palo Alto Networks' AI-driven defense.

## 📁 Structure
- `data/`: Datasets
- `scripts/`: Core logic (training, detection, response)
- `models/`: Saved ML models
- `app/`: Visualization & Dashboard
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter experiments

## 🚀 Goals
- Detect intrusions using ML
- Auto-learn from false alarms using RL
- Automate response to attacks
- Visualize everything in a live dashboard

## 🧠 Models
- XGBoost / Random Forest
- Q-learning Agent (for adaptive detection)
